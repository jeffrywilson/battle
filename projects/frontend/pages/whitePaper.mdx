      # Beast Battle WhitePaper

      _V0.0.2 - 02-07-2022_

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="intro"></a>

      ## Intro

      We at **Ice Cream Social** have built a roadmap for the establishment and growth of the Beast Battle Universe (BBU) as a digital nation. We have broken development into a series of phases so that we can fund the continued development based on the success of the current Phase and Phases prior.

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      We are building the BBU as a digital nation by focusing on two core elements:

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      - Establishing a digital economy around our BBU ERC-20 token
      - Developing engaging digital experiences for players that offer both active and passive play-to-earn rewards

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="bbu-token"></a>

      ### BBU ERC-20 Token

      We will use a BBU-specific ERC-20 token to support interactions with the gaming universe. Players will spend and earn tokens through gameplay. This will include such items as entrance fees for unique events, purchasing equipment and crafting supplies, and breeding Beasts, to name a few. The BBU ERC-20 token will be the backbone on which we build the world.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="digital-experience"></a>

      ### Digital Experiences

      We will develop multiple digital experiences over time, beginning with Patronage and the Battle Royale event in Phase 1. Each Phase will introduce a new game platform to provide new digital experiences. We currently have five experiences being developed which will be built and released over time as the digital nation grows.

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      All game types will be based around an ERC-721 NFT asset referred to as a ‘Beast’. This Beast will be usable in all games as we develop them out. Players will be able to mint multiple Beast tokens as well, offering different playstyles and different approaches to the games as the games are developed.

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      In addition to minting a Beast, players will be able to become Patrons. The BBU is split into two Factions: Esher and Valorin. By choosing a Faction and becoming a Patron of a specific Faction, you may stake a number of BBU ERC-20 tokens to receive both passive and active rewards. From receiving bonus incentives based on your Faction’s performance in certain events to actively influencing the political decisions and military strategies of your Faction, you will be able to engage directly as a Patron.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="our-goals"></a>

      ### Our Goals

      The goals of Ice Cream Social come down to a number of points:

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      - Create engaging digital experiences for players by using the blockchain technologies available, beginning with Ethereum and ETH
      - Build and maintain a digital asset as an ERC-20 token specifically to be used by players in the Beast Battle Universe
      - Leverage the BBU ERC-20 token to allow continued development and support of the world we are building
      - Transition the BBU to a place where players can choose from a number of experiences that are both engaging and potentially lucrative through a play-to-earn model

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="patronage"></a>

      ## Patronage

      Become a Patron by choosing one of the two Factions to back: Esher or Valorin. Once you have chosen a Faction, you have a number of ways to assist them depending on which game mode you want to participate in.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="staking"></a>

      ### Staking

      By staking a number of BBU ERC-20 tokens, you will:

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      - Positively influence game modes for your chosen Faction
      - Earn periodic rewards, all paid out on a pre-set schedule

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      To begin in Phase 1, staking BBU ERC-20 tokens will have a direct impact on your faction by improving the effective stats of all your Faction’s Beasts that are participating in a Battle Royale event. This will increase their chance of winning the event, and by doing so, increases your chances for increased rewards during the scheduled payout to all Patrons.

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      The amount staked for each Faction will proportionately increase the associated attribute for each round of the Battle Royale event. Therefore, the greater number of BBU ERC-20 tokens staked for a Faction, the greater their passive effect will be.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="phase-1.5"></a>

      ### Additional Interactions

      Following the initial launch of the Battle Royale event, two new interactions will be introduced for all Patrons.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="voting"></a>

      ### Voting

      Battle Royale events will consist of a series of rounds, each of which has an associated attribute, i.e. Might or Wit. Beasts with higher attributes matching the specific attribute will have a greater chance of success. Patrons will be given the ability to take part in a ranked choice voting system to determine the rounds chosen for each Battle Royale event.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      Based on the number of tokens staked for a Patron, their votes will have a higher weight. Therefore, if a Patron has a significant amount of BBU ERC-20 tokens staked and their Faction has a number of Beasts with a very high Will value, that Patron could vote for all rounds to have Will as their associated attribute.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="patron-gifts"></a>

      ### Patron Gifts

      Players who’ve entered the Battle Royale will have the ability to assign consumable usage for a specific round of the event. Consumables are one-time-use ERC-1155 tokens that are burnt upon use but will have a significant impact on a single round of the event. Patrons will have a similar interaction through a feature called ‘Patron Gifts’.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      Patron Gifts are ERC-1155 tokens, similar to consumables, that are applied to all Beasts of the Patron’s Faction during the round of the event specified by the Patron. Once rounds have been voted upon, a Patron will be able to see the associated attributes for each round and can apply a Patron Gift for a chosen round. For example, if a specific round has an attribute of Grace, and the Patron’s faction is lacking Beasts with high Grace, the Patron can supply a gift that will increase all of their Faction’s Beast’s Grace for that specific round.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="battle-royale"></a>

      ## Battle Royale

      Battle Royale is the first gaming experience within the BBU. A set number of players from each faction will spend two BBU ERC-20 tokens to join the battle. First, second, and third place will earn a reward!

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      Battle Royale events will take place over the course of a ‘Season’, with a season being 52 weeks. Following the close of a season, a new season will begin after a short break (timing TBD) so that changes can be applied or new features introduced.

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      During a season, a new Battle Royale event will take place every week. Each season will, therefore, have 52 events in total. There will be a cap of 4567 Beasts for each event. The event will take place every Sunday with specific actions available for participants leading up to the event.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="gameplay"></a>

      ### Gameplay

      A Season One Battle Royale event will:

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      - Open Players to sign-up their Beasts
        - Entrance fee is two BBU ERC-20 tokens
      - Assign the event’s rounds
        - Random: pre-Phase 1.5
        - Patron Voting system: Phase 1.5
      - Equipment and Consumables
      - Patron Gifts with Phase 1.5
      - Event takes place over a few hours (timing TBD) every Sunday
        - Series of Rounds
        - Each Round has a collection of winners
        - Each Round has an ‘associated attribute’
        - Final round has a single winner, with second and third receiving smaller rewards
      - Payouts to First, Second, Third place
        - BBU ERC-20 Tokens

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="signing-up"></a>

      ### Signing Up

      A player who has a minted a Beast NFT will be able to sign up. The entrance fee will be two BBU ERC-20 tokens. Sign-ups, depending on demand, will take place within a specific period and will roll over from week to week so that all participants will have a chance to join in.

      <a id="equipment"></a>

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      ### Equipment

      There will be a number of ERC-1155 tokens available for a player to purchase which represent equipment to be used during games. For Phase 1 Battle Royale events, Beasts will be able to equip one weapon and one piece of armor to passively increase their base attributes.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      The Battle Royale consists of a series of rounds with each round targeting a specific attribute, of which there are five: Might, Brawn, Grace, Wit, and Will. A Beast who has a higher attribute for the round will have a higher chance of winning. Equipment, therefore, will be used to passively augment the Beast’s attributes during the event so that a player can increase their chance of winning the event.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      ### Passive, Fixed Bonus

      Equipment will be chosen and set before the event begins. There will be a time leading up to the beginning of the event where players will have the ability to see the event’s selected rounds and to set their weapon and armor. Once that time has expired and the event begins, the chosen pieces of Equipment will be worn by the Beast for the entirety of the event, passively increasing their attributes for every round.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="consumables"></a>

      ### Consumables

      In addition to the ERC-1155 Equipment tokens, there will be a number of ERC-1155 Consumable tokens available for players to purchase. Consumable tokens are similar to Equipment in that they have a direct impact on a player’s chance to win. The drawback to a Consumable token, however, is that the token will be burnt upon use. As it is a one-time use, the effect of a Consumable is significantly more than that of Equipment and can have a greater impact on a player’s chance for success.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      ### Single Use Bonus

      Each Consumable will have a specific effect, and players can choose which round to use them in. The Consumable will, therefore, have a direct impact on the round in which they are used. Following their use, though, the consumable will be lost.

      Players will have a limited number of Consumables to use during a Battle Royale event.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="beasts"></a>

      ## The Beasts

      As there existed a being, created through Fate’s own hand of such great power that they existed outside the Natural and Physical Orders, it became to know itself as Rhanesh. Seeing the worlds before it, spinning unknowingly within time and tied directly to strings of the lesser Fates, Rhanesh decided to embrace the existing Orders and merged itself with a number of greater worlds. As the catalyst event that created what is known now as the world of Rhanesh, the violence of the event being so great that it broke apart the very seams of the Natural and Physical Orders between the worlds, an energy flowed throughout the lands and crystallized itself, existing unknown to those on the land itself.

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      Rising from the chaos and violence of the event was life. Driven by the lesser Fates as time and the Physical and Natural Orders, the Beasts arose. The Beasts are the inhabitants of the world, anthropomorphic entities that have grown out of the violent catalyst.

      <Box className="spacer" height="10px"></Box>

      Within the Valley of Natak in the world of Rhanesh is where we find our two Factions: Esher and Valorin. These two Factions rose from a once peaceful community and now reside on opposite sides of the Valley with the Ebon City, Calad, sitting between them. Calad is a place of neutrality, the merchant keepers of the Valley’s wealth and trade. As Esher and Valorin battle, Calad sits as a strict safe zone for both Factions.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      ### Beast Lives

      Each Beast has 9 lives. As a Beast is eliminated in the Battle Royale event, they will lose a life. After 9 eliminations, that Beast will no longer be able to sign up and participate.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      <a id="beast-tokens"></a>

      ### Beast Tokens

      Each Beast will be minted by first choosing a Beast Model, of which there are 12. The core of gameplay comes down to a numeric value for the five attributes: Might, Brawn, Grace, Wit, and Will. Each attribute represents a Beast’s ability to perform specific actions that require a specific control over their body. Might, for example, represents how well a Beast can exert force within a physical space. Will, on the other hand, exemplifies a Beast’s ability to maintain not only its composure while under duress, but also its ability to withstand punishment that would otherwise break its spirit.

      <a id="beast-roster"></a>

      A player will choose a Faction and Beast Model from a view that shows all
      the Factions and their associated Beasts

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      ### Esher

      - MIGHT: Crocodile
      - BRAWN: Elephant
      - GRACE: Leopard
      - WIT: Deer
      - WILL: Wild Goat
      - BALANCED: Dog
        <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      ### Valorin

      - MIGHT: Hippopotamus
      - BRAWN: Boar
      - GRACE: Tiger
      - WIT: Rabbit
      - WILL: Bear
      - BALANCED: Lion
        <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      Each Beast will have a set of attributes rolled randomly at the time of minting. Aside from the balanced Beasts (Lion and Dog), a Beast’s primary attribute will always be the highest (or tied for highest) when a Beast is minted. Lions and Dogs are balanced, and will therefore have fully random attributes assigned.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      ### Minting a Beast: Attributes

      Player chooses a Beast Model from the 12 at launch. The system ‘rolls’ a weighted roll for a Beast's primary attribute (or random attribute for balanced Beast), the value of which will range from 2 to 5. The system will then ‘roll’ a weighted roll for each random attribute, basing the outcome on initial roll, until all attributes are filled.

      As the primary attribute will be the highest, or tied for highest stat, the initial roll determines all possible outcomes for builds from there.

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      Potential Value Sets:

      - 5 2 1 1 1
      - 4 3 1 1 1
      - 4 2 2 1 1
      - 3 3 2 1 1
      - 3 2 2 2 1
      - 2 2 2 2 2

      <Box className="spacer" height="20px"></Box>

      ### Minting a Beast: Skins

      Each Beast has 3 (to 5) possible skins. Based on the initial roll of the initial stat a skin rarity will be chosen.

      - 5: Rare or Ultra-Rare (20%)
      - 3, 4: Standard
      - 2: Rare or Ultra-Rare (20%)

      As the most common value for the first attribute will be 3 or 4, the standard skin will be assigned for all Beasts with this value. Beyond this, the evenly rolled '2' set will have a rare skin as will the '5' as these both have a lower percentage chance of being rolled.

      In addition, if a 2 or a 5 is rolled, there is a 20% chance to be given a variation of the rare skin.

      Having 12 Beasts, 3 models per Beast, and 2 additional variations for the rare skins, we begin with 36 total models and 60 total skins.
