# Token Format

Each 1155 token will follow a format standard to identify specific aspects of the token.

The token format is intended to allow flexibility in naming conventions for tokens so that all consumers of token id will be able to determine characteristics of the token being supplied.

There is flexibility in the numeric conventions as each token type begins with a 2-digit number in order to increment within the space of 10.

Equipment, for example, is denoted by 20 while trophies are denoted by 30.

_Example Equipment Token Id:_

```
20020125
```

## Token Type

The first two numbers of a tokenId will denote the **Token Type**.

Types:

- 20: Equipment
- 30: Trophies
- 40: Patron Gifts

Each token type will have extended formatting beyond the token type.
